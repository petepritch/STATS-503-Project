# STATS-503-Project
This project is for partial credit of STATS 503 Multivariate Analysis @ The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

## Guidelines

This project is an opportunity to apply the statistical learning techniques covered in class to a real dataset. The project has two parts. The first part is a somewhat open-ended investigation: you will pose and answer two questions using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The second part is a Kaggle competition: you will test your ability to build powerful predictive models. You will submit final reports detailing your analysis.
